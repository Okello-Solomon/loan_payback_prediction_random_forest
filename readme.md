## **Project Overview**

This project predicts loan payback outcomes based on borrower characteristics, financial indicators, and loan details using an XGBoost classification model.
The model is trained, evaluated, and deployed through an interactive Streamlit web application to support data-driven credit risk assessment.

**The project demonstrates a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow:**

data preprocessing → feature engineering → model training → model evaluation → deployment

### **Features**

- Predicts loan repayment or default in real time

- Handles categorical, binary, and numerical features

- Uses robust dummy variable encoding for categorical inputs

- Applies consistent preprocessing during training and inference

- Manages class imbalance for improved default detection

- Interactive and user-friendly Streamlit interface

### **Machine Learning Model**

**Model Used:** Random Forest Classifier

**Objective:** Predict loan repayment outcome

- 1 → Loan repaid

- 0 → Loan defaulted

**Evaluation Metrics:**

- Accuracy

- Precision

- Recall

- F1-Score

- Confusion Matrix

- Validation Strategy:

- Train-test split

- Cross-validation

- Hyperparameter tuning

### **Random Forest was selected due to its:**

- Strong predictive performance on structured tabular datasets

- Ability to capture complex, non-linear relationships between features

- Built-in variance reduction through ensemble averaging (reduces overfitting compared to single decision trees)

- Robustness to noise and outliers

- Capability to handle imbalanced datasets effectively (especially when combined with class weighting techniques)

### **Deployment**

The trained model is deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to input loan and borrower details and receive instant predictions.
Feature alignment between training and deployment is strictly enforced to ensure reliable and consistent predictions.
